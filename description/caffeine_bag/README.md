# Description #

This folder contains bags that record topic messages published during one of Caffeine's runs.

Name is formatted by date and time the bag started recording a run:
caffeine_bag_year_month_day_hour_minute_second.bag

There is a boolean toggle in spawn.launch (if statement) that determines whether to record data
when the file is launched.
