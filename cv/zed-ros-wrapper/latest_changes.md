LATEST CHANGES
==============

2022-04-26
----------
- Add Plane Detection. See [ZED Documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/ros/plane_detection/)

2022-03-30
----------
- Fix wrong TF broadcasting when calling the `set_pose`, `reset_tracking`, and `reset_odometry` services. Now the initial odometry is coherent with the new starting point.

2022-03-28
----------
- Add parameter `sensors/max_pub_rate` to set the maximum publishing frequency of sensors data
- Improve Sensors thread

2022-03-16
-----------
- Fix the frame links of barometer, magnetometer, and temperature sensors for ZED2i

v3.7.x
---------
- Add support for the new Neural Depth mode
- Add support for head detection model
- Add support for sport-related object class
- Add support for X_MEDIUM neural network models
- Enable AI for ZED Mini
- Add new `<zed>_base_link` frame on the base of the camera to easily handle camera positioning on robots. Thx @civerachb-cpr
- Improve URDF by adding 3Â° slope for ZED and ZED2, X-offset for optical frames to correctly match the CMOS sensors position on the PCB, X-offset for mounting screw on ZED2i
- Add `zed_macro.urdf.xacro` to be included by other `xacro` file to easily integrate ZED cameras in the robot descriptions. See [PR #771](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper/pull/771) for details. Thx @civerachb-cpr
- New parameter `save_area_memory_db_on_exit` to force Area Memory saving when the node is closed and Area Memory is enabled and valid.
- Add service `save_Area_map` to trigger an Area Memory saving. 
- New tool function to transform a relative path to absolute.
- Enabled static IMU TF broadcasting even it `publish_tf` is set to false, making the two options independent. Thx to @bjsowa
- Moved the `zed_interfaces` folder in the new [`zed-ros-interfaces`](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-interfaces) repository. The new repository is useful to receive the topics from a ZED node on system where the `zed-ros-wrapper` repository cannot be fully installed, i.e. systems without CUDA support. For this repository nothing changes because the `zed_interfaces` folder is replaced by the `zed-ros-interfaces` git submodule to automatically satisfy all the dependencies.
- Fix sensors topics pubblication for ZED2i. The support for the new camera was not complete
- Fix sensor_msgs type for depth image in OpenNI mode, from `sensor_msgs::image_encodings::mono16` to `sensor_msgs::image_encodings::TYPE_16UC1`. Depth image in OpenNI mode is now compatible with the nodelet `depthimage_to_laserscan`

v3.5.x
---------
- Add support for ROS Noetic
- Add support for SDK v3.5
- Add support for the new ZED 2i
- Add new parameter `pos_tracking/pos_tracking_enabled` to enable positional tracking from start even if not required by any subscribed topic. This is useful, for example, to keep the TF always updated.
- Add new example to start multiple ZED Nodelets inside the same nodelet manager
- Fixed issue #690

v3.4.x
---------
- Add support for new DEPTH16_MM data type for depth (OPENNI MODE)
- Fix issue #660: detected objects topic not published if depth computation not active
- Improved support for ZED Object Detection
- Add Skeleton Tracking support
- New Rviz plugin for Object Detection in `zed-ros-examples`
- New parameters and name changing to fit the new OD features, also the `start_object_detection` service has been modified to match the new features:
  - new `model` parameter to choose the AI model
  - new `max_range` parameter to limit the detection range
  - new `sk_body_fitting` parameter to enable Skeleton fitting for skeleton AI models
  - `people` -> `mc_people` to indicate that it is related to multiclass AI models
  - `vehicles`-> `mc_vehicles` to indicate that it is related to multiclass AI models
  - new `mc_bag` parameter to enable bags detection with multiclass AI models
  - new `mc_animal` parameter to enable animals detection with multiclass AI models
  - new `mc_electronics` parameter to enable electronic devices detection with multiclass AI models
  - new `mc_fruit_vegetable` parameter to enable fruits and vegetables detection with multiclass AI models

ASYNC Object Detection (2020-09-18)
-----------------------------------
- Object Detection now runs asynchronously respect to data grabbing and Object Detected data are published only when available not affecting the frequency of the publishing of the other data types

IMU timestamp fix (2020-08-25)
------------------------------
- Added new parameter `sensors/publish_imu_tf` to enable/disable IMU TF broadcasting
- Fixed duplicated IMU timestamp issue (see ticket #577)

- IMU TF is now published once as static TF even if the IMU topic is not subscribed

Timestamp fix (2020-06-03)
--------------------------
- Fix timestamp update coherency due to parallel threads. Thanks to @matlabbe

IMU fix (2020-05-24)
