# Notes:
# What is the format of the GPS coordinates ? 
# Regarding the acceptance criteria for the issue, this issue is not able to do that. 
# Must integrate with the rest of the gps issues. 
# Need to account for GPS start up time. Need to read in the init gps coordinate. 
# Double check that the other waypoints are given @ competition time.
